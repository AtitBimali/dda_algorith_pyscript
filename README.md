Implementation of DDA Algorithm using pyscript and matplotlib

I have used **pyscript** which allows us to run Python script inside an Html file.

This is a relatively new Framework so you might get some errors and slow perfomance. 

To use pyscript you need to add the following lines in your Html page:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.css" />
<script defer src="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.js"></script>
```
